# Virtual-Novel
Virtual Novel Project with use of Midjourney and Blender

# Objective

Building a Virtual Novel game using the engine Renpy and Python for all development operations. All assets, character sprites, and environments are first created through Midjourney, a software that creates AI Art. Then it is touched up and modified through Blender and Photoshop. The plot and story is also created by me. 

# Project Milestones
