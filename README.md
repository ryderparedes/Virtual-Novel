# Virtual-Novel
Virtual Novel Project with use of Midjourney and Blender

# Objective

Building a Virtual Novel game using the engine Renpy and Python for all development operations. All assets, character sprites, and environments are first created through Midjourney, a software that creates AI Art. Then it is touched up and modified through Blender and Photoshop. The plot and story is also created by me. 

# Project Milestones

*This Project will have several milestones to show some of long terms goals that will be expected in the future.*
- Create concept art and character sheet for character "Hina."
- Create 3D "Hina" model in blender.
- Complete the story.
- Complete all option pathes for Virtual Novel.
- Create all environments and animations for backgrounds.
- Potentially upload the game to steam with a solid final product.
